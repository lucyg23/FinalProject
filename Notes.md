Ideas about my Project
=======================

1. The dataset I plan on using is one I got from USGS website on polar bears in Alaska with their age and cortisol levels found in their hair samples.

2. For manipulating the data set, I plan on creating a graph and the basic statistical analysis I'll do is a regression line for the graph or a line of best fit.

3. For visualizing, I'll be making a graph with age on one axis and cortisol levels on the other. If I have time, I may add sex of the polar bear. And if I still have time I would be interested in creating some sort of map or visualizing geographic data (this is what I would be most interested in so if this is all I can do, I would prefer this!)

4. Kind of answered this in the previous question but would be down to do a geographical data thing which is something I havent' done in any homework assignments yet!

**Additionally**

I think I would really like to look at something with a map (as mentioned previously) but I think this is a skill I could use for my capstone this summer in making a map of where I'm collecting bioluminescent samples.
