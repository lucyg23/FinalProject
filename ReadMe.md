Cortisol Concentration Data From Polar Bears
==================================

**How does the age of a polar bear affect its level of cortisol?**

It's inferred that as polar bears age, their stressors increase because of their independence from parents and need to find food themselves and cover, etc. I hypothesize that as polar bears age, their cortisol levels will increase - especially in mothering polar bears. This is because that's such a vulnerable stage and they not only have to find resources for themselves but also for cubs. 

**Plan**

I plan on creating a graph to show this relationship of cortisol levels and age. I think for the proper data analysis, statistics, I'm going to create a regression line or line of best fit - something like that.
